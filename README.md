# Toy Robot Simulator

This is a Node.js application that simulates the toy robot moving on a square tabletop.
- There are no other obstructions on the table surface.
- The robot is free to roam around the surface of the table, but must be
  prevented from falling to destruction. Any movement that would result in the
  robot falling from the table must be prevented, however further valid
  movement commands must still be allowed.
